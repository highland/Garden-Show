# Garden Show
 Applications to support a garden club annual show

 Originally done with VBA in an Excel spreadsheet.
 This had become unmanageable over the year as changes accumulated.

 The replacement project will be written in python with a simple frontend.
 Uses Tkinter, pickle, and batch input from text files.

 Intended for use by Badenoch Gardening Club, it should however be suitable
 for any Gardening Club that runs a traditional Garden Show
